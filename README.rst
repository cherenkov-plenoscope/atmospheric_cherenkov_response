Atmospheric Cherenkov response
==============================
|BlackStyle| |LicenseBadge|


Cosmic particles, such as gamma-rays, can be detected with the help of the atmospheric Cherenkov-method. The cosmic particles enter earth's atmosphere and induce showers of new particles which run down to ground. Among these new particles is Cherenkov-light which can be detected on ground.
This library helps to estimate how good a given instrument can detect a certain type of cosmic particle at a certain energy (response-function).
